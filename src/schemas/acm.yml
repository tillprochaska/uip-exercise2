                    Discussing related work is important for several reasons.
                    It sets the stage for the research and allows the authors to clarify their own contribution.
                    What have other researchers done? What kind of gap is there in the previous research?
                    How does the work presented in the paper fill that gap or improve or
                    extend previous work and results?

                    Educational sciences, psychology, and other social sciences provide
                    many theories, models, and conceptual frameworks, which also support
                    computing education research. They can provide concepts and vocabulary
                    for discussing research. They can guide research design and
                    interpretation of empirical results and provide a lens for
                    interpreting the results. They can provide stronger arguments in
                    discussing the research, and they can sometimes be used to build and
                    test hypotheses for empirical research.

                    However, within computing education research, there is not always an
                    obvious theoretical basis; for example, because the work may concern
                    the development and use of a new tool or technology, or it may focus
                    on collecting and analyzing data thatis highly computing-specific, and
                    so far no obvious theoretical basis has been developed to address it.
                    If you have suggestions for other or better theoretical framework(s),
                    please provide this feedback for the authors.

                    Research methodology provides a holistic approach to empirical
                    research design for addressing the research questions, including
                    arguments for selecting data collection, methods of analysis,
                    interpretation of results, and discussion of limitations of the
                    work.

                    <strong>Note 1:</strong> The conference also accepts papers which focus on a
                    theoretical discussion of some topic related to computing
                    education. Such papers should clearly argue why empirical work is
                    missing and re-interpret previously published empirical results,
                    or should collect and analyse data to build a proof of concept of
                    the new theoretical contribution.

                    <strong>Note 2:</strong> ICER accepts studies which replicate previous empirical work.
                    In these cases it is important to clearly justify the methodology so
                    that comparison with previous work is possible.

                    <strong>Note 3:</strong> ICER values work using quantitative, qualitative, or mixed
                    methods, and recognizes that both formative studies and summative
                    evaluations can make crucial contributions to the field.

                    The paper should make it clear how it advances the international computing
                    education research field. This typically requires comparison of results to
                    previous related work and/or theoretical basis. Moreover, the authors should
                    express how their work contributes to the audience beyond their local context.

                    Finally, ICER is an international conference and therefore all problems,
                    concepts, or terms which are culturally situated should be made clear in the
                    paper; otherwise international readers might not comprehend the paper. Some
                    examples of such local concepts are AP exam in the US, and ECTS credits in Europe.

                    The overall recommendation is not the average value of your observations above,
                    but it should generally reflect them. For example, even if you like the paper
                    very much, do not recommend Strong accept if you have pointed out several
                    weaknesses in it. Furthermore, even weak papers have some positive aspects.
                    Please point these out to the authors in this field.
